; | Exercise 1: Interpreting function execution |
; +---------------------------------------------+

; Approximate time: 10 minutes
; For this problem, B side drives and A side navigates.

; In this exercise, we will use our substitutive model of Racket program
; execution to predict the behavior of some tricky scenarios involving
; functions.  We will then generalize what we see to arrive at some conclusions
; regarding the behavior of functions.

; Consider the following function definitions:

(define my-func-1
  (lambda (x y)
    (+ x (* y y) x)))

(define my-func-2
  (lambda (n)
    (* n 2)))

(define my-func-3
  (lambda (n)
    (+ (my-func-2 n) (my-func-2 8) n)))

; Give the execution trace (i.e., step-by-step evaluation) of each of
; the following expressions in the space above them.  Note that when you
; evaluate an arithmetic operator with more than 2 arguments, you can
; evaluate the addition in one step, e.g., (+ 1 1 1) --> 3. Make sure
; to write your trace as a collection of line comments so that your
; file still runs successfully. (Similarly to how this prose is just
; one big comment block!)

; Use the explorations pane to check that your trace produces the correct value.
; We recommend checking each intermediate expression as you go.

; a.
;      (my-func-1 (+ 1 1) 5)
; step 1: (my-func-1 (+ 2) 5)
; step2: (+ 2 (* 5 5) 2)))
; step3: 25 + 4
; step 4: 29
;  --> 29

; b.
;     (my-func-2 (my-func-2 (my-func-2 3)))
; step1: (* 3 2)
; step2: (* 6 2)
; step3: (* 12 2)
; step4: 24
; --> 24

; +----------------------+-------------------------------------------
; | Exercise 2: What if? |
; +----------------------+

; Driver: A
; Approximate time: Five to Ten minutes

; The previous exercises might suggest an important maxim regarding functions
; and parameter names:

; > The names of the parameters of a function don't matter.

; To delve into what this means, consider the following alternative
; definition of my-func-2:

(define my-func-2-alt
  (lambda (x)
    (* x 2)))

; With your partner, use your mental model of computation to compare the
; behavior of my-func-2 and my-func-2-alt and in a few sentences, explain what
; the maxim presented above means.  E.g., you might consider

(my-func-2-alt (my-func-2-alt (my-func-2-alt 3)))
; -both of these models give the same output. the only difference is the variable names in the functions

; and compare the evaluation.

; both evaluate to 24

; Write your explanation in the space below:
;
; ; -both of these models give the same output. the only difference is the variable names in the functions
;

; +--------------------+---------------------------------------------
; | Exercise 3: Houses |
; +--------------------+
;
; Driver: A
; Our reading on procedures contained a procedure to make a simple house,
; reproduced below for your use.

; Copied from the CSC-151 reading "Writing your own procedures"
(define simple-house
  (lambda (size)
    (above (triangle size "solid" "red")
           (rectangle (* 0.80 size) size "solid" "black"))))

; a.  Use the Explorations pane to verify that you can create houses of
; different sizes.  You may choose to do the same examples as in the reading or
; you may choose to do a few of your own.

(simple-house 100)
; You need not submit anything for this part of the exercise.

; b.  The original simple-house procedure does not color the house.  Write a new
; procedure, (painted-house size color), in the space below.  The procedure
; should take takes both the size and color as parameters and makes a house of
; that specified size whose main body is in the specified color.  (The roof
; should remain red.)
;
; Make sure to add a comment to painted-house that indicates you adapted this
; code from the reading.  We always credit our sources!

(define painted-house
  (lambda (size colorT colorR)
    (above (triangle size "solid" colorT)
           (rectangle (* 0.80 size) size "solid" colorR))))

(painted-house 50 "blue" "black")


; c.  In addition to this simple-house procedure, the reading also included a
; definition for a more complex house with a door and doorknob.  Use this as the
; basis of a new function, fancy-house, that makes a house of a given size and
; color, including a brown door and yellow doorknob.  Make sure that the size of
; the door scales with the size of the house.

(define door 
  (lambda (size)
(overlay/align "left" "center" (circle (/ size 45) "solid" "yellow") (rectangle (/ size 10) (/ size 5) "solid" "brown") )))


(define fancy-house
  (lambda (size color)
    (above (triangle size "solid" color)
           (overlay/align "middle" "bottom" (door size) (rectangle (* 0.80 size) size "solid" color)))))

(fancy-house  200 "red")
; +------------------------+-----------------------------------------
; | Exercise 4: Snowpeople |
; +------------------------+

; Driver: B
; The reading on images contained an image that looked a bit like a snowperson.

; a. Complete the definition of the procedure, (snowperson size), that creates a
; simple snowperson with three white circles with black outlines, where the size
; is used for the size of the largest part of the snowperson, the base.

(define snowperson
  (lambda (size)
    (above (circle 20 "outline" "black")(circle 40 "outline" "black")(circle (+ 40 size) "outline" "black"))))

(snowperson 50)
; b. Complete the definition of (snowperson-revisited height) that creates a
; simple snowperson with three white circles with black outlines.  Unlike
; snowperson, this function's parameter controls the *total height* of the
; snowperson rather than just the base.  (It should be as close to the height
; parameter as you can get it.)

(define snowperson-revisited
  (lambda (height)
    (above 
    (circle (* .2 height) "outline" "black") 
    (circle (* .3 height) "outline" "black")
    (circle (* .5 height) "outline" "black"))))

(snowperson-revisited 10)
(rectangle 10 10 "solid" "green")
(beside (snowperson-revisited 10) (circle 10 "solid" "green"))
; c.  Complete the definition of (snowperson-with-hat height) that behaves like
; snowperson-revisited but adds a black top hat to the top of the snowperson.
; Note that the total height should include the top hat.

(define hat
(lambda (size) 
(above 
(square (* size .7) "solid" "gray")
(rectangle (* size 1.001) (* .4 size) "solid" "gray"))))


(define snowperson-with-hat
  (lambda (height)
    (above 
    (hat (* .3 height))
    (circle (* .1 height) "outline" "black") 
    (circle (* .2 height) "outline" "black")
    (circle (* .4 height) "outline" "black"))))

(snowperson-with-hat 300)
(beside (snowperson-with-hat 100) (circle 100 "solid" "green"))
; d.  From the prior exercise, you might have realized that top hats are
; universal and should be applicable to any image you can think of.  Define a
; function (add-top-hat width height image) that places a top hat on the given
; size above the provided image.  

; For example, `(add-top-hat 20 10 (circle 20 "solid" "blue"))` will
; add a top hat that is twenty units wide and ten units high to a
; circle of radius 10 and `(addtop-hat 20 30 (snowperson-revisited 50))`
; will had a top had that is 20 units wide and 30 units high to the
; top of a 50-unit-high snowperson.

(define add-top-hat
  (lambda (width height image)
    (above (rectangle width height "solid" "black") image)))
  
  (add-top-hat 20 10 (circle 20 "solid" "blue"))
  (add-top-hat 20 30 (snowperson-revisited 50))

; | Submit the lab |
; +----------------+

; You're done.  Congratulations!  It's time to submit your lab.  After
; doing so, you should review the extra problems below and, as
; appropriate, pick one or more to attempt.  We'd suggest that you
; start with the first extra problem.

; To turn in your work:

; a. If you were working with separate parts, combine the two parts of 
;    the assignment into one file.
; b. Ensure that your file runs properly.  (E.g., when we click "Run", it should
;    work not produce errors.)
; c. Make sure that this file is named `procedures.scm`.
; d. Submit this final file to Gradescope.  Make sure to submit your work 
;    as a group submission and include your partner in the submission.
; e. Wait for the autograder results to make sure that you met the
;    basic goals.

; +---------------------------+--------------------------------------
; | For those with extra time |
; +---------------------------+

; If you find that you have extra time, you should try one or more of
; the following exercises.  We would recommend that you start with
; Extra 1, which reveals some important ideas.

; +----------------------------+-------------------------------------
; | Extra 1: Grids and circles |
; +----------------------------+

; a.  Complete the procedure (grid image) below that takes an image and makes a
;     2-by-2 grid with that image.  For example, (grid (circle ...)) should make
;     something like the this.

;        o o
;        o o

;     Similarly (grid (house ...)) should make something like this.

;       /\  /\
;       ||  ||

;       /\  /\
;       ||  ||

(define grid
  (lambda (image)
    {??}))

; b.  Using grid and the definition of a 2 Ã— 2 checkerboard given below
; define an image called `checkerboard` that looks like a standard
; checkerboard.  That is, squares per row and 8 squares per column 
; (i.e., it is an 8 Ã— 8 board) with alternating red and black squares.  
;
; **Use as little code as possible in your definition.**

(define two-by-two
  (above
    (beside red-square black-square)
    (beside black-square red-square)))

; Note: checkerboard is a value, not a procedure.  No lambda should
; be necessary.
(define checkerboard
  {??})

; c.  As you may know, some modern artists, like Andy Warhol, achieved
;     interesting conceptual pieces by creating grids of the same (or
;     similar) thing.  Using grid, complete the procedure
;     (sixteen-circles color) that makes a grid of sixteen equal-size
;     solid circles of the given color.

(define sixteen-circles
  (lambda (color)
    {??}))

; +-----------------------+------------------------------------------
; | Extra 2: Snowcone-men |
; +-----------------------+

; It gets a bit boring to see our snowpeople in white.  Of course, snowcones
; can be almost any color (depending on what type of syrup you add).

; Write a procedure, (snowconeperson height color), that draws a snowperson 
; in the given color with every circle outlined in black.

(define snowconeperson
  (lambda (height color)
    {??}))

; +-----------------------------------+------------------------------
; | Extra 3: Smiling faces, sometimes |
; +-----------------------------------+

; In the reading on images, we challenged you to create a smiley face.
; Complete the procedure (smiley-face size) that creates a smiley face
; of a specified size.

; TODO: fill me in with a complete definition!
(define smiley-face
  (lambda (size)
    (circle 100 "solid" "yellow")))

; +-----------------------+------------------------------------------
; | Extra 4: More tracing |
; +-----------------------+

; If you feel like you did not completely understand tracing, try tracing
; one more function call.

;     (my-func-3 11)
; --> ...
;

(define example-expr-3 (my-func-3 11))

; +-------------------------+----------------------------------------
; | Extra 5: Counting words |
; +-------------------------+

; As you may recall, we used the following code to count the number
; of words in a string.

;;; (count-words str) -> integer?
;;;    str : string
;;; Determine approximately how many "words" appear in the
;;; given string.
(define count-words
  (lambda (str)
    (length (string-split str " "))))

; a.  Check the behavior of count-words on a few inputs.  Copy and paste
; your experiments here.
;
; ...
;

; b. In your own words, explain how count-words works.
